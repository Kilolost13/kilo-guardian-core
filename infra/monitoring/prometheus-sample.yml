# Note: This sample assumes Prometheus is running in the same Docker network and can resolve 'gateway'.
# To use it:
# 1. Generate an admin token via: curl -X POST http://<gateway>/admin/tokens
# 2. Save the returned token into /etc/prometheus/secrets/gateway_admin_token
# 3. Mount the file into your Prometheus container at that path and start Prometheus with this config.
